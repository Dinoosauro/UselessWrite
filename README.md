# UselessWrite
Write useless data to the disk from your browser

Try it: [https://dinoosauro.github.io/UselessWrite/](https://dinoosauro.github.io/UselessWrite/)
## How it works
Open the website, and then write the phrase you want to be repated. Choose the number of times it should be repeated, and then how many times the file should be downloaded. After that, press on the start button.

If you want something more _random_, you can create the file with random numbers.
## Screenshot
This website is probably one of the simplest I've ever built, and I just care that it can do this type of work. I think it can be useful only on ChromeOS, but since every user partition is encrypted it's not necessary to do this.
